- Employ Spark functionalities to create temporary views, partition data, cache and uncache temporary tables, and validate the uncaching process and fetch executor information from the Spark REST API.

### Setup Instructions:
1. Install Apache Spark.
2. Create a Python virtual environment and install necessary dependencies:
    - `findspark`
    - `jupyterlab`
3. Run JupyterLab and load the notebook.

### Running the Notebook:
